Wordpress Plugin that displays free products like magazines or tracts and let customers place orders without payment.

## Description

On our Sites, we often have some free material to order. Setting up a complete webshop would be an overkill, so I created this plugin. I lets you create products and sort them in to tags and categories. Ad a piucture, and you're good to go. On any page, you can then add a Gutenberg Block to set up a stor with products.

The plugin comes with no css.

## Installation

Either you can install it via git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gollenia/ctx-products.git
cd ctx-products
```

or simply download the plugin and place it in the wp-content/plugins/ directory within your Wordpress installation.

Don't forget to activate.
